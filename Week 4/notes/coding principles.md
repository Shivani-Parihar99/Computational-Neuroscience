Question:
If fluctuations in some stimulus start out large and suddenly decrease in amplitude (without changing the stimulus average), the optimal input-output curve for a sensory neuron encoding the stimulus will:

stretch (become less steep)
contract (become more steep)
shift right (towards higher input values)
shift left (towards lower input values)

Answer:
contract (become more steep)

Explanation:
If the amplitude of stimulus fluctuations decreases, the probability distribution of stimulus values will become skinnier. 
To adjust for this change in stimulus statistics, a sensory neuron responding to the stimulus should correspondingly squeeze its input-output curve to best encode a smaller range of stimulus values. 
This way, the input-output curve will go back to being similar to the cumulative integral of the stimulus distribution (as described earlier in this lecture), and the neuron will be able to efficiently encode the range of the stimulus.

Coding Principles:
--- Coding efficiency
--- Adaptation to stimulus statistics
--- Sparseness

What have we missed??

In next lecture, the bio-physics of coding will be discussed.
